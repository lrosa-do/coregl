OpenGL Graphics Driver
Overview

This repository contains an OpenGL graphics driver implemented in C++ for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. The driver provides a set of classes and methods for managing rendering resources, shaders, textures, and GUI elements. It is designed to be flexible, efficient, and easy to integrate into OpenGL-based projects.
Features

    Shader Management: Easily set and switch between shaders for different rendering effects.
    Texture Handling: Load and manage textures for applying to 3D models or rendering GUI elements.
    GUI Support: Integration with ImGui for creating interactive graphical user interfaces.
    Rendering Primitives: Draw 2D and 3D primitives such as lines, boxes, spheres, cones, and more.
    Transformations: Apply transformations to model and view matrices for positioning and orientation.
    State Management: Control rendering states such as depth testing, blending, and scissor testing.
    Performance Metrics: Retrieve statistics on rendering performance, including FPS, draw calls, and vertex count.
